<h1> Administration - Hardware </h1>
<p>
  For the commissioning of the device following steps should be performed. It is presumed that the printer is already transformed into a colony picker.
</p> 

<h2> Overview </h2>
<p>
  The colony picker consist of a 3d printer which is controlled by a mini pc (Raspberry Pi). The pc is getting its commands from a server located elsewhere. The heated bed as well as the heating element for the nozzle are disconnected and should not be operate able. The colony picker needs a mains power source, a network connection and 5 bar air pressure via a 6mm quick coupling.
</p>

<h2> Additional Parts </h2>
<p> Here are additional items listed needed to assemble the device. </p>

<h2> Step by Initial Step </h2>
<p>
  This step by Step guide will bring you through the assembly of the colony picker, it is assumed that all parts are already on hand.
</p>

<h3> 1. Assembly </h3>
<p>
  Assemble the printer according to the manufactures instruction. Now screw the pneumatic scissors into the Petri dish holder. Afterwards place the petri dish holder onto the heating bed. Now the Petri dish holder can be mounted onto the printer to do this first place the screws heads up inside the frame and fixated it with a nut (This nut will now hold the Petri dish bed onto the heating element). A further nut has to be placed on top of the last on, for later high adjustment. Afterwards put the screws through the dedicated holes of 3d printer's heating bed holder and fixated it with another nut. Now assemble the switch for the pneumatic scissors to do this glue it into the switch holder and position it into the Petri dish holder. <br>

<h3> 2. Positioning </h3>
<p>
  Position the colony picker on a plane surface, make sure it has enough space to all sides. Also check the 3d printer&acirc;&#128;&#153;s manual for further instruction.
</p>

<h3> 3. Wiring </h3>
<h4> Raspberry </h4>
<p>
  Connect the raspberry pi to the printer with mini usb cable and with a network cable to the network. Lastly connect it to the printers power supply. <br>

<h4> pneumatic scissors </h4>
<p>
  The pneumatic scissors have to be connected to the magnetic valve. Please check the image for the correct orientation. <br>

</p>

<h4> magnetic valve </h4>
<p>
  The magnetic valve has to be connected to the contact switch mounted on the Petri dish holder and to air pressure check the attached images for the correct orientation.
</p>

<h4> 3d printer </h4>
<p>
  Finally plug the 3d printer into the main powerline, as soon as you turn it on, also the attached Raspberry Pi will start.
</p>

<h3> 4. Calibration </h3>
<p>
  Now slowly move the printers head to the front left corner of the Petri dish holder. After you reached that location slowly move it to the back and adjust the nuts, so that the distance between nozzle and Petri dish holder stay the same. After you reached the back do the same moving right.
</p> 

<h3> 5. Filament </h3>
<p>
  Insert the filament, check "Refilling the filament" in the chapter "Configuration Hardware" for this step.
