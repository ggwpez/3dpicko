    <h2> About </h2>
      <p>
      This is the manual belonging to the colony picker C3PickO. 
	  The "User Manual" is directed to the common user of the picker 
	  and explains how to use it and the software. 
	  "Administration" is targeting administrator only and explains how 
	  to setup the hardware and software and how to configure the picker.
      </p>
      <p>
      The "User Manual" consists of three chapters. "First Steps" explains what precondition have to be met for operating the device. "Example Picking Process" demonstrates how a successful colony picking process is done. "Advanced Settings" explains all further settings.
      </p>
      <p>
      Please note that the specification given are geared to and testet with the hardware provided by the TU Darmstadt (camera 3D printer, 3d printed parts). However they can be transfered to similar hardware.
      The contact person is <a href="mailto:kabisch@bio.tu-darmstadt.de">Prof. Dr. Johannes Kabisch</a>. </p>

  <h1> First Steps </h1>
  <p> Before starting any picking process please make sure all preconditions are met. These steps are very important. Not complying with them can not only destroy your experiment but also damage the device. </p>
  Check if the following is given: <br>
  <div id="precondition">
  <ul>
  <li> The colony picker is located on a plane non-flammable surface in a well ventilated room. </li>
  <li> There is enough filament for processing the colony pick (for each colony about 1 cm filament is needed). </li>

  <h2> 1. Take the Picture </h2>
  <p>
    This step has great impact on how easy and exact the picket process will be. Therefore this step should not be rushed and done with great diligence.
  </p>
  <img src="./img/wiki/Colony_Dish.jpg"  width="400"> <br>
  <p>
    These are the recommended condition under which the photo should be taken: <br>
    <b>Camera settings:</b>
	<ul>
      <li>aspect ratio: 16:9 (13 MP)</li>
      <li>brightness: 0</li>
      <li>ISO: 100</li>
      <li>light source: bottom (add top if necessary)</li>
      <li>light colour: white</li>
    </ul>
	<b>Petri dish:</b>
	<ul>
	  <li>Make sure the surface on which you put the Petri dish is clean.</li>
      <li>Put the red frame onto the Petri dish. (Under UV-Ligt a fluorescent Frame is necessary)</li>
	  <li>Put the Petri dish inside of the camera module.</li>
	  <li>Turn the Petri dish so that the angled side are to the left.</li>
      <li><u>Centre the Petri dish as good as possible.</u></li>
      <li>Zoom in until there is at least 2 cm space left to each side.</li>
	  <li>Check for correct camera rotation.</li>
    </ul>
	Take the picture and check wether it has good contrast. Afterwards copy it to the device you intend to start the picking process with.
    Afterwards remove the red frame carefully.
  </p>
  
  <h2> 2. Insert the Petri Dishes into the Socket </h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> Put the plates into the socket according to the socket's inscription </li>
      <li> Mind the correct orientation </li>
	  <li> Do not forget to remove the covers of the plates</li>
      <li> Mistakes can damage the picker </li>
    </ul>
    It should look like this: <br>

  <!--
  <h2> 5. Cut Image </h2>
  <p>
    In this step you have to cut the picture to the right size in order for the image recognition to be able to recognize the colonies and also to get the right offsets from all Petri dish walls for the picker (you don't want it to pick beside the colonies). For this you use your mouse to move the rectangle to correct position of the Petri dish. You can adjust the size when grabbing the edges. After you have cropped the image to the right size, you can click on "Next Step".
    This is an example: <br>

      This setting is similar to the Area setting, but instead of setting the limits directly you define a deviation from the calculated average colony. You have three options to choose from: <br>
  	<p>
	    <b>Area</b> <br>
        How much smaller or bigger the colonies can be from the average.
	  </p>
  	<p>
        <b>Brightness</b> <br>
  	  This is for selecting the brightness. It is possible to choose colonies with different colours or fluorescent ones. Note that different colours can have the same brightness. You might want to change the colour of the lightning while photographing to improve results.
	  </p>
  	<p>
	    <b>Circumference</b> <br>
  	  How much smaller or bigger the circumference of colonies can be from the average, this setting is interesting if you have non-round colonies.
	  </p>
  	With mean you select the actual deviation for filtering, in this example image, the area of colony two is larger than the area of colony one but the circumference of colony one is actually greater than the one of colony two. It is possible to use either area or circumference to select the colonies intended for the pick. <br>

  <h2> Step by Step Assembly</h2>
  <p>
    These instructions will guide you through the assembly of the colony picker. It is assumed that all parts are already on hand.
  </p>
  
  <h3> 1. Assembly of the printer</h3>
  <p>
  <!--
    Assemble the printer according to the manufactures instruction. But do not mount or connect the heating bed. Now screw the pneumatic scissors into the Petri dish holder. Now the Petri dish holder can be mounted onto the printer to do this first place the screws heads up inside the frame and fixated it with a nut (This nut will now hold the Petri dish bed onto the heating element). A further nut has to be placed on top of the last on, for later high adjustment. Afterwards put the screws through the dedicated holes of 3d printer's heating bed holder and fixated it with another nut. Now assemble the switch for the pneumatic scissors to do this glue it into the switch holder and position it into the Petri dish holder. <br>
    -->
    Assemble the printer according to the manufacture's instructions. Note that you do not need to mount or connect the heating bed. Insert a screw in the drilling at the scissors mounting place. Then mount the pneumatic scissors onto the socket. Now mount the socket onto the printer's bed holder. Fixate each screw with a nut (This nut will now hold the Petri dish bed onto the heating element). A further nut has to be placed on top of the last on for later leveling of the socket. Afterwards put the screws through the dedicated holes of the 3D printer's heating bed holder and fixate them with nuts again. At last attach the pneumatic scissor's switch to the socket. You can use tape or glue to fasten it.<br>

  </p>
  
  <h3> 2. Positioning </h3>
  <p>
    Position the colony picker on a plane surface. Make sure it has enough space to all sides, so that the socket can move unhindered on the x,y axes. Also check the 3d printer’s manual for further instruction.
  </p>
  
  <h3> 3. Wiring </h3>
  <h4> Raspberry Pi</h4>
  <p>
    Connect the raspberry pi to the printer with mini usb cable and with a network cable to the network. Lastly connect it to the printers power supply. <br>
    3D printers USB connection: <br>

    <img id="check_network_connection" src="./img/wiki/check_network_connection.jpg"  width="400">
  <h4> Pneumatic Scissors </h4>
  <p>
    The pneumatic scissors have to be connected to the magnetic valve. Please check the image for the correct orientation. <br>
    <img src="./img/wiki/pneumatic_scissors.jpg"  width="400">
  </p>
  
  <h4> Magnetic Valve </h4>
  <p>
    The magnetic valve has to be connected to the contact switch mounted on the socket. 
	For checking air pressure manually press the switch right sided to the scissors to activate them. 
	They should close automatically and open after releasing the switch. <br>
    <img id="pneumatic_scissors_switch" src="./img/wiki/pneumatic_scissors_switch.jpg"  width="400">
  </p>
  </p>
  
  <h4> 3D Printer </h4>
  <p>
    Finally plug the 3d printer into the main power line. As soon as you turn it on, also the attached Raspberry Pi powers up.
  </p>
  
  <h3> 4. Calibration </h3>
  <p>
   <!--
    It is important that the socket is leveled. Otherwise the filament might not pick all colonies or might even collide with one of the plates inside the socket. For leveling it move the printers head carefully to the socket's front left corner (e.g. by hand or webinterface of the pickers mini pc). After you reached that location move it carefully to the back and adjust the nuts, so that the distance between nozzle and socket stay the same. After you reached the back do the same moving right.

For leveling it move the printers head carefully from one of the socket's corner to the other (e.g. by hand or webinterface of the pickers mini pc). While doing so adjust the nuts to the effect that the distance between nozzle and socket is everywhere the same.
  </p> 
  
  <h3> 5. Filament </h3>
  <p>
    Insert the filament. Operate the handle at the stepper motor. <br>

  <h2> Install Software </h2>
  <p>There are two options available for installing the software. Either use the "Ready to use VM" or the "Manual Installation </p>
  <h3> Ready to use VM </h3>
  <p>
    The ready to use software is delivered as a hdd image and an XML configuration file for the vm. This image has to be installed on a server. The network configuration has to be set up so that the server is accessible by the users and the server has access to the mini pc controlling the picker. The user's pc does not necessarily need a direct connection to the printer, however it is recommended for trouble shooting purposes (e.g. for manual controlling the picker).
  </p>
  <h3> Manual Installation </h3>
  <p>
  <!--
    The Software needs some libraries e.g. for the image recognition. For installing all the dependencies as well as the software there is a script available which will do that for you. Natural you can use the script to check those commands.
