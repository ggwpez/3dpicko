<h1> First Steps </h1>

<p> Before starting any picking process please make sure all preconditions are met, these steps are very important since not complying them can not only destroy your experiment but also damage the device. </p>
- For safety reasons the colony picker has to be located on a plane non-flammable surface in a well ventilated room. <br>
- There must be enough filament for processing the colony pick (for each colony about 1 cm filament is needed). <br>
- The filament has to be extruded up to the end of the nozzle. Please refer to the chapter manual extrusion in "Configuration Hardware" for more information on that topic. <br>
- The waste bin needs to have enough space to not overflow while picking. <br>
- There must be air pressure available, you can test this with manually activating the pneumatic scissors, for more information see "Configuration Hardware" <br>
- The picker must be connected to power and the red power button on the right has to be switched on (the display is no indication since it can also be lit when the picker is turned off). <br>
- The picker needs a working network connection. <br>
