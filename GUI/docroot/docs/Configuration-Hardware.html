<h2> Refilling the filament </h2>
<p> For replacing the filament operate the handle at the stepper motor. <br>

   Now the stepper motor lost grip and the present filament can be pulled out. Afterwards the new filament can be inserted in the handles hole and pushed past the stepper motor into the tube. Push the filament until it reaches the nozzle, sometimes it tangles with the brass tube connection. To fix this the tube connection can be unscrewed and the filament manually placed into the brass adapter and screwed on again. When finished make sure the filament is located at the tip of the nozzle. <br>

  Only if this is met the printer can determine the filament exact location and pick correctly.
