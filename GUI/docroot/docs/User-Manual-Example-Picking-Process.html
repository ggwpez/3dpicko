<h1> Guide through the picking process </h1>
<p>
  This guide will bring you through the picking process, you should already have done all preparation in "First Steps". Since this is intended to make the start into the picking process as easy as possible most functions are not mentioned here. To get a better understanding for those please refer to "Advanced Settings". </p>

<h2> 1. Taking the picture </h2>
<p>
  This step has great impact on how easy and exact the picket process will be. Therefore this step should not be rushed and done with great diligence. Select the following camera settings: <br>
  aspect ratio: 16:9 (13 MP), <br>
  brightness: 0, <br>
  Iso: 100. <br>
  Now put the red frame on top of the Petri dishes you wish to have picked and put the dish into the camera, the angled sides should be on the left hand side. Make sure the camera rotation is correct. It is possible to fade in a grid for getting the alignment between Petri dish and edges of the picture right. <!-- <br>

  Now turn on the under light and zoom in as far as possible yet still having about 1 cm space around the Petri dish. Pay attention that the Petri dish is centred, it will affect the picking quality if the Petri dish is displaced to any side and hence the perspective improper! After you have pressed the camera shutter check if the picture has good contrast. After you are satisfied with the result copy the picture to the pc you intend to start the picking process with.
  Here is an example of a good image: <br>

  Afterwards you can carefully remove the red frame.
</p>

<h2> 2. Inserting the Petri dishes into the colony picker </h2>
<p>
  Insert the Petri dishes into the colony picker, the orientation and placement are written into the frame. It is crucial that you comply with it, otherwise the picking process will fail and the colony picker can get damaged.
  It should look like this: <br>

  Note the correct orientation!
  </p>

<h2> 3. Open Web interface </h2>
<p>
  Now enter the following URL into your browser: c3picko.bio.tu-darmstadt.de you will be welcomed with the following page: <br>

</p>

<h2> 4. Choose Image </h2>
<p>
  You have two option to upload the picture you can either click on "Drop Image" and select the picture with your favourite file explorer or drag and drop it in the dedicated area. If you have uploaded the image beforehand you can select it below the photo upload within "All Images".
</p>

<h2> 5. Cut Image </h2>
<p>
  In this step you have to cut the picture to the right size in order for the image recognition to be able to recognize the colonies and also to get the right offsets from all Petri dish walls for the picker (you don't want it to pick beside the colonies). For this you use your mouse to move the rectangle to correct position of the Petri dish. You can adjust the size when grabbing the edges. After you have cropped the image to the right size, you can click on "Next Step".
  This is an example: <br>

<h2> 5. Set Attributes </h2>
<p> Insert here Information about the pickjob, the date will automatically inserted. This information will be displayed in the "History". </p>

<h2> 6. Detect Colonies </h2>
<p>
  The colony detection runs automatically when you reach this step. After changing any settings the colony detection will automatically be redone. Besides changing the settings on the right hand side you can also klick the colonies in the picture to get more information about them and to include (shown in white) or exclude them from your selection. For more information about the different filter settings you can click the name to display the help from the "Advanced Settings". To find out why colonies are not included in your selection you can click the "Excluded" button above the image of the Petri dish, this will display all detected colonies in the colour of the filter which excludes them. <br>

</p>

<h2> 7. Choose Plates </h2>
<p>
  Here you have to select what kind of PCR dish you want to use, click the drop down menu and select the appropriate one. Afterwards you can select with which well you wish to start. This is useful if your PCR dish is already partially occupied. The wells which will be used are shown in green. If you have selected more colonies than there is space available on the pcr dish or manually set the amount of colonies the excess colonies will be discarded.
  This is an example of a 96 well pcr dish: <br>

<h2> 8. Overview </h2>
<p>
  This site shows you all the configuration you have done before and is intended as a mean to exclude any errors before starting the picking process
</p>

<h2> 9. Start Picking </h2>
<p> Here you can finally start the picking process. </p>

<h2> 10. Finishing </h2>
<p>
  After the picking process is complete you can remove the Petri dishes from the colony picker and start your experiments. Please don't turn the printer off via the power switch, first the integrated pc needs to be turned off. Best leave this to the administrators ;)
